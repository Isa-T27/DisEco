This image displays the relationship between a host, pathogen and the environment regarding infection and disease. These systems are very complex as there are various components that impact how these three points interact with each other. For example a condition in the environment could have an effect on a host that allows the pathogen to more easily infect the host.

## **Worksheet 2**

1.  **Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a heard of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.**

    1.  The sample size would be 59 deer.

2.  **Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:**

    1.  **95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population**

    2.  **99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population**

        1.  The sample size requirement for scenario 1 with an infinite population is 299 while the sample size requirement for scenario 2 with an infinite population is 229. One might think that the 99% confidence would have a higher sample size, however, the percentage of prevalence has a stronger effect. Since scenario 2 is looking at a higher prevalence, detection is more likely, so fewer samples are needed to reach the confidence percentage. Basically, the rarer/less prevalent the disease is, more samples are needed.

3.  **You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%**

    1.  Since no cases were detected in the sample, the rule of three will be used to solve the prevalence. 3/300 = 0.01 = 1%. Therefore, I am 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure is \<1%.

## **Worksheet 3**

Jan's research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

1.  Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.
    1.  On 06/12/25 there are five new cases detected in the population size of 56. Since there are five old cases, I subtracted 56-5=51. To solve for incidence, I calculated 5/51 and got 0.098 cases per elk-day.
    2.  On 06/14/25, there are two new cases and three recovered cases. Since there are seven old cases that have not been subtracted from the population, I did 51-7 and got 44. Since there are 2 new cases I divided 2/44 and got 0.045 cases per elk-day.
    3.  On 06/15/25, there are no new cases, but there are three new recovered cases, bringing total to 6 recovered. The incidence for this day is zero (0).
    4.  Incidence is written in new cases per unit of time since we are looking for the number of new cases during a fixed period of time.
2.  What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.
    1.  The prevalence on 06/13/25 for the total population is 12 infected/56 population, which gives us 21.4%. For the sample population, I calculated 12/14 and got 85.7%.
    2.  The prevalence on 06/16/25 for the total population is 5/56, which is 8.9%. For the sample population, I calculated the 5 infected over the 14 elk sampled and got 35.7%.
    3.  Prevalence is written in a percentage since we are solving for the number of animals affected as a proportion of the population.
3.  On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence?
    1.  On 06/10/25 the prevalence and incidence are the same. Both are solved by calculating 1/56, which gives 0.0178. Since this is the first day of observation and there is only one new case, the numbers are the same for each formula.
4.  On which day is the incidence lowest?
    1.  Incidence is lowest on 06/10/25. This is because there is only one new infected case observed, so the rate is not very high.

## **Tick Lab Report**

Ticks are very efficient vectors and are able to transmit a broader range of diseases compared to any other vector besides mosquitoes. Due to their efficiency, the rates of Tick-Borne Diseases (TBDs) are rising as the host of ticks expand. In order to identify ticks, there are specific characteristics we can observe to identify the species. First we identify the life stage by counting the legs present and if there is a genital pore. Ticks go through four life stages; egg, larva, nymph, and adult. If the tick has six legs it is a larva and if it has eight legs it is either a nymph or adult. If the tick has eight legs and a genital pore, it is an adult tick. The next step in identification is to identify the sex of the tick. If the tick has an alloscutum it is a female and if it has a conscutum it is a male. In order to identify the genus we look at if the anal groove is posterior or anterior. Finally, to identify the species we need to use the dichotomous key. Another identification method is the SAM methods, which looks as is the scutum is patterned or not, if the anal groove is anterior or posterior and if the mouth parts are long or short. Using these methods we can identify the species of ticks to determine which diseases it can transmit.

## **Worksheet 4**

MERS-CoV

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels\
(dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to\
humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has\
resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause\
severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.\
Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by place of infection and month of onset, April\
2012 – September 2025 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)

![](images/clipboard-2054687787.png)

Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct?

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations.
    1.  False, MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in camel populations.
2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV.
    1.  True.
3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV.
    1.  True.
4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%.
    1.  False, the estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 35%.
5.  The epidemic curve indicated this is a point source outbreak.
    1.  False, this is not a point source outbreak since the curve shows multiple peaks spread across multiple years.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Worksheet 5**

Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

1.  Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

    1.  I would classify this outbreak of Marburg virus as a spillover event since there is not sustained human-to-human transmission. When looking at the framework for classifying disease threats, we can see that the within-H~2~ transmission rate is too low to sustain the pathogen and the between-species transmission from H~1~ is also too low. When we look at the case of potential emerging infectious diseases, the within-H~2~ transmission is much higher than a spillover event. Since Marburg virus has a low transmission rate between the second host, it would be classified as a spillover event.

2.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

    1.  Some measures that could reduce risk of transmission are: target control, blocking tactics and reservoir control. These measures can be implemented in both community and healthcare settings. The goal of target control is to control the infection within the target population, for example, humans. This method is crucial in a healthcare setting in order to reduce the chance of a potential emerging infectious disease. Blocking tactics can be used to prevent transmission between the reservoir and target host population. This measure helps prevent spillover events from happening, which can turn into a potential emerging infectious disease. The next measure is reservoir control, which involves suppressing infection within the reservoir. This is a great control method that helps reduce the risk of transmission because if we can control the disease in the reservoirs, there is a reduction in the risk of transmission to the target population.

## **Worksheet 6**

A new disease, *Vertico,* has been detected in fish in two separate ponds. Your task is to analyze the sample data to determine and compare the disease prevalence between the two ponds.

**Pond 1:**

-   Prevalence

    -   30%

-   95% CI (%)

    -   Lower: 14%

    -   Upper: 53%

**Pond 2**

-   Prevalence

    -   6.7%

-   95% CI (%)

    -   Lower: 0.3%

    -   Upper: 30%

-   Fisher's exact test p-value

    -   0.1987

-   Interpretation

    -   The difference is [not]{.underline} statistically significant since *p* \> 0.05, meaning the results could have occurred by chance.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Worksheet 7**

[Nipah Virus]{.underline}

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission\
in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ\
between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive\
measures recommended in each setting.

-   Malaysia and Bangladesh experience different transmission pathways of Nipah virus. Pathways i and ii happen in Malaysia and pathway iii happens in Bangladesh. In pathway i, a bat will partially eat some fruit and then leave the virus in the fruit. Pathway ii is when an animal, for example a pig, will eat the infected fruit and the infected pig can spread the virus to humans working with the animal. Since the virus is spreading through contact with animals, prevention methods would focus on avoiding contact with infected animals, washing and peeling fruit before eating and keeing animals away from bats. Pathway iii involves date palm sap collection, which is a method of sugar production in Bangladesh. In this case, infected bats will go into the pots hanging in the trees and spread the virus to humans that consume the sugar. Prevention methods in Bangladesh would include protecting date sap from contamination and avoid consuming raw date palm sap.

[Avian Reovirus]{.underline}

Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the\
different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its\
transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes?\
Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe\
its impact on the affected population.

-   Avian reovirus can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route or through egg transmission. ARV can persist for weeks in litter and contaminated surfaces due to environmental contributors like poor sanitation, contaminated feed and water and multi-age housing systems. ARV is very resilient and stable in the environment, allowing it to persist in feces for a while until it is transmitted to another bird, which supports the fecal-oral route.

[Langya henipavirus]{.underline}

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China.\
Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV\
classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

-   The likely reservoir for LayV are shrews and it is likely transmitted through contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids, like saliva or blood. LayV is classified as a spillover since it has only been reported in two provinces in China, the Henan and Shandong provinces, and has not spread globally. This means LayV is not a potential EID and is a spillover.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Worksheet 8**

In this assignment, we were given a dataset from the examination of raccoon roundworm (*Baylisascaris procyonis*), a nematode worm which was found during the necropsies of 61 raccoons collected in Missouri and Arkansas during 2013 and 2014. In order to analyse this data we are using Quantitative Parasitology to determine prevalence patterns and compare between different groups. When looking at prevalence from all 106 necropsies, 50 raccoons were infected with the parasite.

![](images/clipboard-3635147082.png)

-   Using Sterne's method with confidence level at 95%, the prevalence of the parasite in all necropsies is 47.2% with the lower confidence level being 37.7% and the upper confidence level being 56.8%. The prevalence in this sample population is high, so the worm is common to find in these raccoons.

![](images/clipboard-172044577.png)

-   Looking at the adult raccoons, there were 69 total with 36 being infected which gives us a prevalence of 52.2%. At a confidence level of 95%, the lower confidence level is 40.4% and the upper confidence level is 63.8%. Over half of the adult population is infected with the parasite.

![](images/clipboard-1327440887.png)

-   Out of the 37 young adults, 14 were infected which gives us a prevalence of 37.8%. The confidence level is 95% and the lower confidence level is 23.4% and the upper confidence level is 54.1%.

    ![](images/clipboard-2989033403.png)

<!-- -->

-   Now lets compare prevalence between adults and young adults. Out of 69 adults, 36 were infected and 33 were not infected, which gives us a prevalence of 52.2% as mentioned previously. When looking at the young adults, there were 37 total with 14 infected and 23 not infected, giving us a prevalence of 37.8%, also previously mentioned. Now lets look at the p-value, which is 0.2206. Since this number is greater than 0.05, this means the results are not statistically significant. Therefore, the results could be due to random chance and do not show a pattern. Since the worm is transmitted by feces, adults and young adults would probably have the same chances of getting infected.

![](images/clipboard-4227039306.png)

-   When comparing the prevalence between males and females using Fisher's exact test, we can see that the parasites are more prevalent in female raccoons. Out of 37 females, 24 were infected and 13 non-infected, giving prevalence as 64.9%. As for the 69 males, 26 were infected and 43 were not infected with the prevalence of 37.7%. Since the p-value is 0.0087, which is less than 0.05, showing that this result is statistically significant, which means it is unlikely this occurred by random chance. Based off of these results, we can conclude that the worms are more widespread in female raccoons compared to male raccoons. This means that sex plays a role in the infection by this worm.

![](images/clipboard-2707801959.png)

-   When comparing the different regions the raccoons were from, the North had 49 total with 14 infected and 35 not infected. This leads us to a prevalence of 28.6% in the North. The Central region has 14 total with 9 infected and 5 not infected, which gives us a prevalence of 64.3%. In the South region, there were 43 total with 27 infected and 16 not infected. This give us a prevalence of 62.8% in the South. The p-value is 0.0016, which is less than 0.05, meaning the results are statistically significant. We can conclude that the parasite is more widespread in the Central region, with the Southern region being the second most prevalent and the Northern region being the least prevalent. The North is actually much lower than Central and South, which leads me to believe that environmental/climate differences could play a role.

Overall, this roundworm seems to be more prevalent in female raccoons and in raccoons located in the Central and Southern regions. Females have higher prevalence probably due to different physiological and behavioral factors that make susceptible to infection. When compared the three regions, prevalence is higher in the Central and Southern regions, which implies that climate and the environment could have something to due with the differences in prevalence. Since the prevalence in the North is so much lower, I think that the cooler climate is the reason for this. Parasitic worms typically thrive in warm, humid climates. Since the data was collected during November through February, there would be less worms in the North where the climate is colder.

## **Worksheet 9**

1.  In 2024, a multistate *Salmonella* outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of *Salmonella*? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of *Salmonella* transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection.

    1.  Three practices that increase the risk of *Salmonella* transmission are direct contact with backyard poultry, contact with contaminated environment and from contaminated eggs. These behaviors help human infection since poultry is able to shed *Salmonella*, having contact with these contaminated areas will increase transmission. *Salmonella* is also able to persist in the environment for a long time, so if environment is not clean it is more likely to get infected. Additionally, since these flocks are living in someones backyard, it is more common for the people who raise the flock to be in direct contact with them, increasing the risk of transmission.

2.  Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock.

    1.  What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal endophyte?

        1.  The main advantage is that Tall fescue will gain an increase in persistence when infected with a fungal endophyte. This makes the Tall fescue more durable, drought resistant and rapid regrowth.

    2.  What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems?

        1.  The climate, soil nutrients and grazing pressure all can influence the toxin levels in fescue.

    3.  What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle?

        1.  The key clinical signs of fescue toxicity are weight loss, rough, discolored hair coats and poor performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Worksheet 10**

1.  What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF?

    1.  There are multiple different transmission routes including vector borne via *Ornithodoros* tick bites, direct contact from infected pig to non-infected pig, indirect contact with contaminated feed, environmental persistence and humans can act as mechanical vectors. Humans play a role in transmission from the transport of pigs and pork products across borders, feeding practices that involve food waste spreading the virus, illegal trade which includes wild boar meat and untreated pork, delayed detection in smallholder systems and poverty and limited compensation discourage reporting.

2.  Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity, progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas.

    1.  Koala retrovirus acts similarly to human retrovirus HIV, which causes an acquired immunodeficiency virus. KoRV will suppress the immune system of koalas, which causes a high prevalence of Chlamydia infection and worse symptoms in koalas. Co-infection drives higher mortality and infertility rates as well as exhibiting greater bacterial loads. Co-infection increases the severity, speeds up the progression and makes management more difficult in koalas.

3.  Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is an emerging threat to wild snake population in North America. What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of SFD?

    1.  One key challenge is that there are diagnostic challenges when using qPCR, which can give false negatives. Another challenge is that it is difficult to monitor snakes and symptoms can take awhile to become visible. Additionally, brumation makes surveillance and management more difficult since there is a high mortality rate in infected snakes during brumation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Final Exam**

1.  True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect **(10 points)**

    a.  Per the community–epidemiology continuum proposed by Fenton and Pedersen\
        (2005), a disease caused by a pathogen with high between-species transmission and\
        no within–target species transmission will be termed a spillover.

        **False; A spillover is defined as causing low between-species transmission and has low within-target species transmission.**

    b.  A viral disease that is transmitted to susceptible hosts only by vectors is infectious as\
        well as contagious.

        **False; A viral disease transmitted only by vectors is infectious, however it is not contagious since it requires a vector to transmit. If a human gets infected with the disease from a vector, he or she will not transmit the disease to another human.**

    c.  The eggs of Baylisascaris procyonis can be transmitted to humans by direct\
        contact immediately after excretion by an infected raccoon.

        **False; Once the eggs are excreted in feces by an infected raccoon it takes about 2-4 weeks in the external environment before the egg become infectious.**

    d.  A fungus growing on tall fescue leaves is responsible for decreased feed intake in\
        cattle grazing on this grass, resulting in reduced weight gain and lower milk production.

        **This statement is true.**

    e.  Northern cardinals are considered superspreaders species for West Nile virus.

        **False; Northern cardinals are supersuppressors of the West Nile virus and robins are considered superspreaders.**

2.  List the community-based interventions used for preventing dracunculiasis\
    transmission in endemic regions. Explain how each intervention interrupts specific\
    stages of the Guinea worm life cycle. How have these strategies evolved in recent years\
    given the emergence of animal (particularly dog) infections? **(10 points)**

    **Some of the intervention methods used to combat dracunculiasis are to prevent infected individuals from entering water sources and the use of protective wells, pipe filters, and larvicide. The cycle of infection begins when an infected individual enters a water source to find relief from the pain of the blister that has an exposed worm. Once in the water, the worm will release thousands of larvae into the water. Preventing those who are infected from coming in contact with water sources will stop the contamination of the water source, which interrupts the first stage of the Guinea worm life cycle. Drinking water that is contaminated with dracunculiasis will cause an infection, so ensuring safe drinking water is important. Preventative measures like a protected well will ensure that no infected individual can contaminate the water and also contains no water fleas, which is where the dracunculiasis larvae will begin maturing. Pipe filters are also used to ensure that drinking water is being filtered of contaminates. Additionally, larvicide is used in stagnant water sources to target larvae before it can cause infection. These preventative measures interrupt the water fleas ingesting the larvae, which is where it become mature third-stage larvae. With the emergence of animal infections, especially in dogs, surveillance of the infection had increased significantly. There were reward systems in place for those in the community that reported infected animals, which gave initiative to the community. Infected animals were also kept away from water sources, usually by tethering the dogs. The dogs were also not allowed to eat fish entrails that could be contaminated, which greatly improved infections in animals.**

3.  Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease of cervids and one of\
    the most significant wildlife conservation challenges in North America. What are the\
    main obstacles wildlife agencies face in managing and controlling CWD? **(10 points)**

    **Managing and controlling chronic wasting disease (CWD) is very challenging for wildlife conservationist. This prion disease currently has no vaccination and no treatment options available and so there are limited tools that can effectively manage and control the transmission of CWD. Another obstacle is that detecting CWD in the early phase is not accurate and the prion can be transmitted asymptotically. Some of the infected will not show any signs of disease, which makes it difficult to detect. Not being able to detect CWD early is a problem, since when it is detected in a population, the disease has already been established and is challenging to get rid of. Some considerations that can limit the management of CWD are logistical, financial, and sociopolitical considerations. There are multiple stakeholders involved in wildlife management and they have an effect on decision making and the strategies used. Hunters, ranchers, farmers, tribes, the Department of Agriculture, BLM, Forest Service, and Forest-owners all play a role in the management of wildlife. The preventative strategies in place focus on prohibiting the movement of live cervids and carcasses by the captive cervid industry. There are also bans on natural cervid urine-based products that are used as lures and bans on baiting and feeding. One of the effective strategies for managing CWD is by non-selective harvest in areas that are known to have CWD. This involves increases hunting pressure by increasing bag limits, extending hunting season, and having post-season removal of targeted cervids. Overall, there are not many strategies for CWD management that have been implemented and properly assessed. The main goal in dealing with this disease is to prevent widespread establishment of CWD in regional populations.**

4.  You are given data from a closed study population of 60 RFID-tagged armadillos\
    monitored at sampling stations (no capture required). At the start of the study\
    (December 2024) none were infected with Mycobacterium leprae. During the follow-up\
    period, monthly assessments documented the following counts of infected animals in\
    the population:\
    • March 2025: 3 infected\
    • April 2025: 5 infected\
    • May 2025: 5 infected\
    • June 2025: 8 infected\
    • July 2025: 13 infected\
    (No deaths, births, immigration, or recovery occurred during the study.)

5.  A beaver carcass was found at the Gunnison River Whitewater Park, Gunnison,\
    Colorado in October 2025. Samples collected during the postmortem examination were\
    submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. The lab reported that the animal was\
    positive for Tularemia.

    a.  Name the etiological agent of this disease. What subspecies of this agent causes\
        Tularemia in aquatic animals like beavers? **(2 points)**

        ***Francisella tularensis*** **is the agent that causes this disease and the subspecies *F. tularensis* subspecies *holartica* causes Tularemia in aquatic animals.**

    b.  What are the different routes of transmission for this agent? **(2 points)**

        **This agent can be vector-borne and is transmitted by tick and deer fly bites. It can also be transmitted through direct contact with an infected animal, inhalation of contaminated aerosols, and ingestion of contaminated water or game meat.**

    c.  Describe key features/characteristics of this pathogen in the context of human health/\
        public health. **(3 points)**

        **So far there have been no reports of Tularemia being transmitted from human to human, however this microorganism is classified as a Category A bioterrorism agent, which means it is the highest priority to public health. Due to the agents ability to infect through aerosol and vectors and its high infectivity, it has been used as a bioweapon through out history.**

8.  Georgia has a white-tailed deer population of \~ 1 million. A total of 1351 samples from\
    hunter-harvested deer were tested for Chronic Wasting Disease in 2022. None of the\
    samples tested positive for CWD. Using the hypergeometric distribution, Georgia\
    DNR determines that CWD is not present above 0.2% prevalence in Georgia’s white-\
    tailed deer population. You are asked to comment on Georgia DNR’s CWD surveillance\
    approach. In your commentary, explain the downside of using hypergeometric\
    distribution for making decisions about wildlife disease surveillance. **(10 points)**

    **First, there were not enough samples taken and tested to really get a good overview of prevalence in Georgia's white-tailed deer populations. According to the hypergeometric distribution table, a population of 100,000 at 0.1% prevalence at 90% confidence requires a sample size of 2,276. This surveillance had a population of \~1 million at 0.2% prevalence and only had 1,351 samples. The main downside of using this method is that it assumes sampling is random, which usually is not the case in hunter-harvested surveillance. Another downside is that testing is not always perfect. CWD testing can give false negatives, which does not provide accurate assessments on prevalence. Overall, this method can overestimate confidence that CWD is absent in the population.**

9.  Place the following diseases in appropriate quadrants in the above figure. Explain your\
    choice of quadrants. **(10 points)**

    ![](images/clipboard-3468681542.jpeg){width="374"}

    a.  SARS-CoV-2

        **This pathogen would be best classified as a true multihost pathogen. SARS-CoV-2 has already emerged and caused a global pandemic so it would not be a potential EID. This pathogen is maintained by more than one host species, thus making it a multihost pathogen. There is self-sustaining transmission in humans as well as animal species. White-tailed deer are an example of an animal that can sustain transmission in populations. This all means that the within and between species transmission rates are high.**

    b.  Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome

        **HPS is a spillover pathogen since it can be maintained exclusively in the reservoir host and humans are considered dead-end host. HPS could not be a multihost pathogen since it does not transmit from human-to-human. The within host transmission rate is too low to circulate pathogen and the between species transmission is also low.**

    c.  Langya Henipavirus

        **I placed Langya Henipavirus as an EID since it has recently been identified that transmission to humans can occur. There is high within-H2 transmission rate and low between species transmission. This could also be classified as a spillover.**

    d.  Brucellosis

        **I would classify Brucellosis as an apparent multihost pathogen since it can infect different species, but is maintained in one or a few reservoir hosts. Humans are a dead-end host and will not transmit the disease. Here the within species transmission is low and the between species rate is high. If we did not include humans it would be a true multihost pathogen.**

    e.  West Nile virus

        **West Nile virus is a true multihost pathogen. The virus is maintained through transmission is more than one host species. This virus has vector-host cycling between birds and mosquitoes, so two different host are required. Both within and between species transmission rates are high, so the virus can persist in either host populations.**

10. Anisakiasis is the disease caused by infection with the stomach worm Anisakis\
    simplex. It reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in marine mammals. In the following\
    figure, identify the definitive host, a dead-end host, a paratenic host, and an\
    intermediate host. Explain your answers. **(8 points)**

    ![](images/clipboard-1229997827.png){width="445"}

    -   **Definitive host are the marine mammals since this is where the worm larvae reaches sexual maturity.**

    -   **Dead-end host would be humans since the larvae can't mature in humans.**

    -   **Paratenic host would be seafish and cephalopods. These sea creatures transport the larvae to marine mammals after being consumed. They can also transport the larvae into humans, but the parasite will not mature.**

    -   **An intermediate host would be crustaceans since they consume the larvae and passes it on to either a fish or directly to marine mammals.**

11. All infected hosts are diseased. Comment using appropriate examples. **(3 points)**

    **Not all host that have an infection will become diseased. An example would be that the meningeal worm does not cause disease in deer, however, an infection of the worm can cause disease and death in elk populations. Rabies is another example since some bats that are infected with lyssaviruses show no signs of disease.**

12. Klepac et al. estimated an R0 of 2.5 for the 2002 Phocine Distemper virus epidemic\
    in Dutch harbor seals. Assuming that an effective PDV vaccine is available, what\
    proportion of the seal population should be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of\
    PDV? **(3 points)**

    **1-(1/2.5)= 1-0.4= 0.6**

    **This calculation shows that 60% of the seal population should be vaccinated in order to prevent an outbreak of PDV.**

13. What are some of the main challenges in managing wildlife diseases? Explain using\
    relevant examples. **(6 points)**

    **Some of the main challenges involved in the management of wildlife diseases are that hosts and pathogens move freely in the environment, hosts are difficult to gain access to and monitor, and there are limited tools available to help in treatment and control of wildlife diseases. The relationship between the hosts, pathogen, and environment is extremely complicated, which only adds to the challenges. An example would be how Saiga antelope will travel and then gather in one spot to give birth, which is related to mass mortality events in the antelopes. The pathogen that caused this is *Pasteurella multiocida,* which is normally present in the host and typically does not cause harm. However, when the antelope are in a very crowded environment and giving birth, this causes stress. The environment where they give birth also has a higher temperature and humidity that the antelope are used to. The changes in stress and environment cause this usually harmless pathogen to cause mass mortality events.**
