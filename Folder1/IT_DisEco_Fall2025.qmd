This image displays the relationship between a host, pathogen and the environment regarding infection and disease. These systems are very complex as there are various components that impact how these three points interact with each other. For example a condition in the environment could have an effect on a host that allows the pathogen to more easily infect the host.

1.  **Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a heard of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.**

    1.  The sample size would be 59 deer.

2.  **Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:**

    1.  **95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population**

    2.  **99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population**

        1.  The sample size requirement for scenario 1 with an infinite population is 299 while the sample size requirement for scenario 2 with an infinite population is 229. One might think that the 99% confidence would have a higher sample size, however, the percentage of prevalence has a stronger effect. Since scenario 2 is looking at a higher prevalence, detection is more likely, so fewer samples are needed to reach the confidence percentage. Basically, the rarer/less prevalent the disease is, more samples are needed.

3.  **You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%**

    1.  Since no cases were detected in the sample, the rule of three will be used to solve the prevalence. 3/300 = 0.01 = 1%. Therefore, I am 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure is \<1%.

Jan's research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

1.  Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.
    1.  On 06/12/25 there are five new cases detected in the population size of 56. Since there are five old cases, I subtracted 56-5=51. To solve for incidence, I calculated 5/51 and got 0.098 cases per elk-day.
    2.  On 06/14/25, there are two new cases and three recovered cases. Since there are seven old cases that have not been subtracted from the population, I did 51-7 and got 44. Since there are 2 new cases I divided 2/44 and got 0.045 cases per elk-day.
    3.  On 06/15/25, there are no new cases, but there are three new recovered cases, bringing total to 6 recovered. The incidence for this day is zero (0).
    4.  Incidence is written in new cases per unit of time since we are looking for the number of new cases during a fixed period of time.
2.  What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.
    1.  The prevalence on 06/13/25 for the total population is 12 infected/56 population, which gives us 21.4%. For the sample population, I calculated 12/14 and got 85.7%.
    2.  The prevalence on 06/16/25 for the total population is 5/56, which is 8.9%. For the sample population, I calculated the 5 infected over the 14 elk sampled and got 35.7%.
    3.  Prevalence is written in a percentage since we are solving for the number of animals affected as a proportion of the population.
3.  On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence?
    1.  On 06/10/25 the prevalence and incidence are the same. Both are solved by calculating 1/56, which gives 0.0178. Since this is the first day of observation and there is only one new case, the numbers are the same for each formula.
4.  On which day is the incidence lowest?
    1.  Incidence is lowest on 06/10/25. This is because there is only one new infected case observed, so the rate is not very high.

**Tick Lab Report**

Ticks are very efficient vectors and are able to transmit a broader range of diseases compared to any other vector besides mosquitoes. Due to their efficiency, the rates of Tick-Borne Diseases (TBDs) are rising as the host of ticks expand. In order to identify ticks, there are specific characteristics we can observe to identify the species. First we identify the life stage by counting the legs present and if there is a genital pore. Ticks go through four life stages; egg, larva, nymph, and adult. If the tick has six legs it is a larva and if it has eight legs it is either a nymph or adult. If the tick has eight legs and a genital pore, it is an adult tick. The next step in identification is to identify the sex of the tick. If the tick has an alloscutum it is a female and if it has a conscutum it is a male. In order to identify the genus we look at if the anal groove is posterior or anterior. Finally, to identify the species we need to use the dichotomous key. Another identification method is the SAM methods, which looks as is the scutum is patterned or not, if the anal groove is anterior or posterior and if the mouth parts are long or short. Using these methods we can identify the species of ticks to determine which diseases it can transmit.

MERS-CoV

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels\
(dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to\
humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has\
resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause\
severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.\

Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct?

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations.
    1.  False, MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in camel populations.
2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV.
    1.  True.
3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV.
    1.  True.
4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%.
    1.  False, the estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 35%.
5.  The epidemic curve indicated this is a point source outbreak.
    1.  False, this is not a point source outbreak since the curve shows multiple peaks spread across multiple years.

Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

1.  Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

    1.  I would classify this outbreak of Marburg virus as a spillover event since there is not sustained human-to-human transmission. When looking at the framework for classifying disease threats, we can see that the within-H~2~ transmission rate is too low to sustain the pathogen and the between-species transmission from H~1~ is also too low. When we look at the case of potential emerging infectious diseases, the within-H~2~ transmission is much higher than a spillover event. Since Marburg virus has a low transmission rate between the second host, it would be classified as a spillover event.

2.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

    1.  Some measures that could reduce risk of transmission are: target control, blocking tactics and reservoir control. These measures can be implemented in both community and healthcare settings. The goal of target control is to control the infection within the target population, for example, humans. This method is crucial in a healthcare setting in order to reduce the chance of a potential emerging infectious disease. Blocking tactics can be used to prevent transmission between the reservoir and target host population. This measure helps prevent spillover events from happening, which can turn into a potential emerging infectious disease. The next measure is reservoir control, which involves suppressing infection within the reservoir. This is a great control method that helps reduce the risk of transmission because if we can control the disease in the reservoirs, there is a reduction in the risk of transmission to the target population.

**Worksheet 7**

[Nipah Virus]{.underline}

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission\
in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ\
between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive\
measures recommended in each setting.

-   Malaysia and Bangladesh experience different transmission pathways of Nipah virus. Pathways i and ii happen in Malaysia and pathway iii happens in Bangladesh. In pathway i, a bat will partially eat some fruit and then leave the virus in the fruit. Pathway ii is when an animal, for example a pig, will eat the infected fruit and the infected pig can spread the virus to humans working with the animal. Since the virus is spreading through contact with animals, prevention methods would focus on avoiding contact with infected animals, washing and peeling fruit before eating and keeing animals away from bats. Pathway iii involves date palm sap collection, which is a method of sugar production in Bangladesh. In this case, infected bats will go into the pots hanging in the trees and spread the virus to humans that consume the sugar. Prevention methods in Bangladesh would include protecting date sap from contamination and avoid consuming raw date palm sap.

[Avian Reovirus]{.underline}

Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the\
different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its\
transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes?\
Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe\
its impact on the affected population.

-   Avian reovirus can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route or through egg transmission. ARV can persist for weeks in litter and contaminated surfaces due to environmental contributors like poor sanitation, contaminated feed and water and multi-age housing systems. ARV is very resilient and stable in the environment, allowing it to persist in feces for a while until it is transmitted to another bird, which supports the fecal-oral route.

[Langya henipavirus]{.underline}

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China.\
Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV\
classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

-   The likely reservoir for LayV are shrews and it is likely transmitted through contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids, like saliva or blood. LayV is classified as a spillover since it has only been reported in two provinces in China, the Henan and Shandong provinces, and has not spread globally. This means LayV is not a potential EID and is a spillover.

**Worksheet 8**

In this assignment, we were given a dataset from the examination of raccoon roundworm (*Baylisascaris procyonis*), a nematode worm which was found during the necropsies of 61 raccoons collected in Missouri and Arkansas during 2013 and 2014. In order to analyse this data we are using Quantitative Parasitology to determine prevalence patterns and compare between different groups. When looking at prevalence from all 106 necropsies, 50 raccoons were infected with the parasite.

![](images/clipboard-3635147082.png)

-   Using Sterne's method with confidence level at 95%, the prevalence of the parasite in all necropsies is 47.2% with the lower confidence level being 37.7% and the upper confidence level being 56.8%. The prevalence in this sample population is high, so the worm is common to find in these raccoons.

![](images/clipboard-172044577.png)

-   Looking at the adult raccoons, there were 69 total with 36 being infected which gives us a prevalence of 52.2%. At a confidence level of 95%, the lower confidence level is 40.4% and the upper confidence level is 63.8%. Over half of the adult population is infected with the parasite.

![](images/clipboard-1327440887.png)

-   Out of the 37 young adults, 14 were infected which gives us a prevalence of 37.8%. The confidence level is 95% and the lower confidence level is 23.4% and the upper confidence level is 54.1%.

    ![](images/clipboard-2989033403.png)

<!-- -->

-   Now lets compare prevalence between adults and young adults. Out of 69 adults, 36 were infected and 33 were not infected, which gives us a prevalence of 52.2% as mentioned previously. When looking at the young adults, there were 37 total with 14 infected and 23 not infected, giving us a prevalence of 37.8%, also previously mentioned. Now lets look at the p-value, which is 0.2206. Since this number is greater than 0.05, this means the results are not statistically significant. Therefore, the results could be due to random chance and do not show a pattern. Since the worm is transmitted by feces, adults and young adults would probably have the same chances of getting infected.

![](images/clipboard-4227039306.png)

-   When comparing the prevalence between males and females using Fisher's exact test, we can see that the parasites are more prevalent in female raccoons. Out of 37 females, 24 were infected and 13 non-infected, giving prevalence as 64.9%. As for the 69 males, 26 were infected and 43 were not infected with the prevalence of 37.7%. Since the p-value is 0.0087, which is less than 0.05, showing that this result is statistically significant, which means it is unlikely this occurred by random chance. Based off of these results, we can conclude that the worms are more widespread in female raccoons compared to male raccoons. This means that sex plays a role in the infection by this worm.

![](images/clipboard-2707801959.png)

-   When comparing the different regions the raccoons were from, the North had 49 total with 14 infected and 35 not infected. This leads us to a prevalence of 28.6% in the North. The Central region has 14 total with 9 infected and 5 not infected, which gives us a prevalence of 64.3%. In the South region, there were 43 total with 27 infected and 16 not infected. This give us a prevalence of 62.8% in the South. The p-value is 0.0016, which is less than 0.05, meaning the results are statistically significant. We can conclude that the parasite is more widespread in the Central region, with the Southern region being the second most prevalent and the Northern region being the least prevalent. The North is actually much lower than Central and South, which leads me to believe that environmental/climate differences could play a role.

Overall, this roundworm seems to be more prevalent in female raccoons and in raccoons located in the Central and Southern regions. Females have higher prevalence probably due to different physiological and behavioral factors that make susceptible to infection. When compared the three regions, prevalence is higher in the Central and Southern regions, which implies that climate and the environment could have something to due with the differences in prevalence. Since the prevalence in the North is so much lower, I think that the cooler climate is the reason for this. Parasitic worms typically thrive in warm, humid climates. Since the data was collected during November through February, there would be less worms in the North where the climate is colder.
