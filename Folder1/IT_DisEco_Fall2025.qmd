This image displays the relationship between a host, pathogen and the environment regarding infection and disease. These systems are very complex as there are various components that impact how these three points interact with each other. For example a condition in the environment could have an effect on a host that allows the pathogen to more easily infect the host.

1.  **Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a heard of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.**

    1.  The sample size would be 59 deer.

2.  **Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:**

    1.  **95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population**

    2.  **99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population**

        1.  The sample size requirement for scenario 1 with an infinite population is 299 while the sample size requirement for scenario 2 with an infinite population is 229. One might think that the 99% confidence would have a higher sample size, however, the percentage of prevalence has a stronger effect. Since scenario 2 is looking at a higher prevalence, detection is more likely, so fewer samples are needed to reach the confidence percentage. Basically, the rarer/less prevalent the disease is, more samples are needed.

3.  **You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%**

    1.  Since no cases were detected in the sample, the rule of three will be used to solve the prevalence. 3/300 = 0.01 = 1%. Therefore, I am 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure is \<1%.

Jan's research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

1.  Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.
    1.  On 06/12/25 there are five new cases detected in the population size of 56. Since there are five old cases, I subtracted 56-5=51. To solve for incidence, I calculated 5/51 and got 0.098 cases per elk-day.
    2.  On 06/14/25, there are two new cases and three recovered cases. Since there are seven old cases that have not been subtracted from the population, I did 51-7 and got 44. Since there are 2 new cases I divided 2/44 and got 0.045 cases per elk-day.
    3.  On 06/15/25, there are no new cases, but there are three new recovered cases, bringing total to 6 recovered. The incidence for this day is zero (0).
    4.  Incidence is written in new cases per unit of time since we are looking for the number of new cases during a fixed period of time.
2.  What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.
    1.  The prevalence on 06/13/25 for the total population is 12 infected/56 population, which gives us 21.4%. For the sample population, I calculated 12/14 and got 85.7%.
    2.  The prevalence on 06/16/25 for the total population is 5/56, which is 8.9%. For the sample population, I calculated the 5 infected over the 14 elk sampled and got 35.7%.
    3.  Prevalence is written in a percentage since we are solving for the number of animals affected as a proportion of the population.
3.  On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence?
    1.  On 06/10/25 the prevalence and incidence are the same. Both are solved by calculating 1/56, which gives 0.0178. Since this is the first day of observation and there is only one new case, the numbers are the same for each formula.
4.  On which day is the incidence lowest?
    1.  Incidence is lowest on 06/10/25. This is because there is only one new infected case observed, so the rate is not very high.

**Tick Lab Report**

Ticks are very efficient vectors and are able to transmit a broader range of diseases compared to any other vector besides mosquitoes. Due to their efficiency, the rates of Tick-Borne Diseases (TBDs) are rising as the host of ticks expand. In order to identify ticks, there are specific characteristics we can observe to identify the species. First we identify the life stage by counting the legs present and if there is a genital pore. Ticks go through four life stages; egg, larva, nymph, and adult. If the tick has six legs it is a larva and if it has eight legs it is either a nymph or adult. If the tick has eight legs and a genital pore, it is an adult tick. The next step in identification is to identify the sex of the tick. If the tick has an alloscutum it is a female and if it has a conscutum it is a male. In order to identify the genus we look at if the anal groove is posterior or anterior. Finally, to identify the species we need to use the dichotomous key. Another identification method is the SAM methods, which looks as is the scutum is patterned or not, if the anal groove is anterior or posterior and if the mouth parts are long or short. Using these methods we can identify the species of ticks to determine which diseases it can transmit.

MERS-CoV

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels\
(dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to\
humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has\
resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause\
severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.\

Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct?

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations.
    1.  False, MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in camel populations.
2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV.
    1.  True.
3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV.
    1.  True.
4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%.
    1.  False, the estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 35%.
5.  The epidemic curve indicated this is a point source outbreak.
    1.  False, this is not a point source outbreak since the curve shows multiple peaks spread across multiple years.

Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

1.  Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

    1.  I would classify this outbreak of Marburg virus as a spillover event since there is not sustained human-to-human transmission. When looking at the framework for classifying disease threats, we can see that the within-H~2~ transmission rate is too low to sustain the pathogen and the between-species transmission from H~1~ is also too low. When we look at the case of potential emerging infectious diseases, the within-H~2~ transmission is much higher than a spillover event. Since Marburg virus has a low transmission rate between the second host, it would be classified as a spillover event.

2.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

    1.  Some measures that could reduce risk of transmission are: target control, blocking tactics and reservoir control. These measures can be implemented in both community and healthcare settings. The goal of target control is to control the infection within the target population, for example, humans. This method is crucial in a healthcare setting in order to reduce the chance of a potential emerging infectious disease. Blocking tactics can be used to prevent transmission between the reservoir and target host population. This measure helps prevent spillover events from happening, which can turn into a potential emerging infectious disease. The next measure is reservoir control, which involves suppressing infection within the reservoir. This is a great control method that helps reduce the risk of transmission because if we can control the disease in the reservoirs, there is a reduction in the risk of transmission to the target population.
